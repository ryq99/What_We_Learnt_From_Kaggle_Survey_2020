# What_We_Learnt_From_Kaggle_Survey_2020

This notebook focuses on two questions: 
1. What should data scientists think important in 2020?
2. How to set up growth as data scientists?

Key take-aways and actions:
1. Important Things To Note ⭐⭐⭐
* Having at least a Master's degree is important for data-related jobs, but it's becoming less important
* Know Python 🐍, learn 🐍, master 🐍, and integrate 🐍 with the other languages you regularly use to build a network 🕸️ in your brain 🧠 
* Free services like Google Colab and Kaggle Notebook are the must to know, but don't completely ignore pay services like Amazon Sagemaker because pay 💰 means better experiences and better quality, and it might be closer to the industry needs
* Visalization is intended to be used to deliver people's thoughts, which is beyond being fancy. It could be simple or complicate and it could be built using any tool/packages (Tableau|Matplotlib|Seaborn|Ggplot|...). However, it must be easy to understand and interactive ✨
2. Growth 🚀🚀🚀
* Focus on learning new things in the first 4 years of career. Find your job needs, build up and stick to 4-5 skills as your core 🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼 to make yourself unique and standout. But don't forget to be open-minded and have some knowledge on other things
* Engage with the community and interact with others by sharing your work and learning from others, it is all-time important!
